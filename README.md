## Modes of operation of sram 

### **1. Hold mode :** 
WL=0 ==> Access transistors M1,M6 will be off . The circuits preserves one of two stable operating points . Therefore, data is held .
#### SNM curve 

<img align="center" width="1000"  src="/Waveforms/SNM_CURVE.png">

Calculated SNM value for above curve is 0.59 .

### **2. Read mode :**
WL=1 ==> Aceess transistors will be on.
For Read '1': Q = 1 and Q = 0 Bit lines are precharged to Vdd .In this operation M2 , M3 off . Voltage of BL bar starts decreasing. Both bitlines are connected to data
read circuitry and small difference is detected and amplified as logic'1'.
Similarly read '0' operation is done .

Note : Condition for cell stability in read operation  is Kpdn > Kaccess  i.e CR (CELL RATIO) should be grater than 1 .

#### Precharge circuit :

#### Sense amplifier :  

Here sen is active-0 read enable signal .

### **3. Write mode :**
WL=1 ==> Aceess transistors will be on .
Write '0 ': Initially Q=1 and Q = 0. Here BL is forced to 0 and this causes M4 and M6 transistors conduct .
When Q less than Vth of M1 then M1 gets off. Qb becomes high as PMOS(M2) connected toVdd will be ON and Q becomes low i.e logic'0'. That i.e write operation is done by forcing bitlines bl and br , which is done using write driver circuit .

Note : Condition for cell write completion is Kaccess > Kpup . 

#### Write Driver :

Here we is active-0 write enable signal .

## IP usage 
The user of this IP has to install Ngspice (Open source Circuit Simulator)
### Ngspice for Simulation
**For Ubuntu **
Open terminal and type the following command to install Ngspice 
```
$ sudo apt-get install -y ngspice
```
### Steps to use Ngspice

To enter the Ngspice Shell, open the terminal & type :
```
$ ngspice
```
To simulate a netlist, type :
```
ngspice 1 ->  source <filename>.cir
```

You can exit from the Ngspice Shell by typing :
```
ngspice 1 ->  exit
```
or
 
```
ngspice 1 ->  quit
```

There are several waveforms that need to be obtained to observe the performance of the Bandgap reference circuit .

### For Simulation of this IP

To clone the Repository and download the Netlist files for Simulation, enter the following commands in your terminal .

```
$  sudo apt install -y git
$ git clone https://github.com/aishwaryapenumarthi/SRAM.git
$ cd SRAM/Spice_lib
```
#### To Run Simulation 
**Example :** To run simulations of trigate circut , type the below command 
```
$ ngspice tri_gate.cir.out
```
Which gives you following waveforms :

<img align="center" width="1000"  src="/Waveforms/trigate_output.png">

## Future work

1.Magic layouts of above subcircuits are need to be done . 

2.OpenRam compiler will be used , which aids memory design . For Openram compiler, spice netlist, magic files, and gds for each and every block (i.e subcircuit) must be provided . Therefore, .mag, .gds files of all subcircuits should be generated .

3.The setup script and technology directory for osu018  has to be created .
